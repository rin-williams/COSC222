# 222-8-TrieHashTableBST

The goal is to compare the performance of Trie vs. Binary Search Tree vs. Hash table for finding words in the English language. Consider the English words available at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/raw/master/words.txt. Store those words in each data structure then time how long it takes to search for each word one, after the other, in each data structure. Your output must display
<pre>
Trie: 2,456s
Red-Black tree: 4,345s
Hash table: 123s
</pre>
with your appropriate timings for your experiment. 

For this assignment you are allowed to use code from the internet e.g. to use the Trie implementation from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/ provide (1) you respect the copyright of any code you use, and (2) comments in your assignment clearly indicate where the code is coming from. The binary search tree may be any balanced binary search tree e.g. AVL, Red-Black, B-tree, etc.
 
Submit all the code needed to do the experiment, including appropriate unit testing, and the output provided by your measurements on your computer as comments in your code.
