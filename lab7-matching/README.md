# 222-7-matching

Perform an experimental analysis of the efficiency (number of character comparisons performed) of the brute-force, Boyer-Moore, KMP, and Rabin-Karp pattern-matching algorithms for varying length patterns. Run the analysis on the text at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices using the first 100 words of that same page. In addition to all the code you use (including adequate unit and coverage testing), submit a table summarizing the results (for each algorithm indicate the total number of comparisons).

You can translate the JavaScript implementation at https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/Algorithms.html (that implementation is useful for unit testing). Implementation of the Rabin-Karp pattern-matching algorithm are available on the web, e.g. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rabin-karp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/. 

P.S. Should you use any code that is not your own, you are responsible for (1) checking the license allows it and (2) giving proper credit. You won't be penalized for using somebody's else code in this lab except if you fail to check both copyright and giving proper credits.
