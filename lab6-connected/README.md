# 222-6-connected
A Social network can be modeled as an undirected graph (vertexes are persons and edges record whether they know each other). We say that two persons are connected if there is a path connecting them. Given a social network, write an efficient method to determine if 2 persons are connected. The objective is to leverage pre-processing time to decrease the query time, i.e. assuming the graph is pre-processed, what is the least amount of time needed to check that Annie and Joe are connected? Your code should be commented to indicate the data structure used, and the resulting complexity.
